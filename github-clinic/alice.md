# GitHub practice from the browser

Working on GitHub.com, we contribute changes through **commits**. You'll practice creating several commits by making small edits to a file, writing commit messages, and committing changes to see them posted nicely online to communicate our work. You'll practice with the file with your name on it; everyone has their own file to practice with. 

## Task 1: Commit an edit from the browser

Let's edit this file by clicking the pencil icon at the top-right of the file. 

Next, make an edit to the text in this file. One idea is to fix this typo. Yay for learning git hub!

Finally, we will commit these edits to GitHub. To do this, press the green "Commit Changes..." button. Committing changes has two steps: write a human-readable Commit message, and press the green button to commit changes. 

Note: In the browser, GitHub will suggest "Update file.md" as the commit message. But you can be more descriptive - practice writing commit messages that help you remember detail about what you changed.

## Task 2: Practice Markdown 

Now let's practice Markdown and commit another edit to this file. 

This file is written in Markdown, which formats text on the web. To see the Markdown that results in the following formatting, click the pencil icon to edit, or click 'Raw' to inspect it. For example, with Markdown:

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

### We can make headers.

We can make lists â€“ *note that lists need an empty line before list items!*

1. cakes & coffee
2. tacos
3. bananas
4. tamales

Second list
1. Here I made a new list
2. And second item on list! 

We can make hyperlinks in [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) using the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. For example:

> [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

We can make an indented quote block with the `>` symbol, as in the example above.

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, by adding a preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. For example: 

![](../horst-champions-trailhead.png)

You can copy a photo from the internet and paste it here:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a28fc9-eea5-44b9-9d2f-62b356d54f15)

You can copy a photo from your local computer and past it here:
![rainer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49f460c9-431b-4f8d-8e6a-55a5f1e98e4e)

*Note that this image lives in the folder one level above our `github-clinic` folder, and we indicate that with the two periods `..`* 

Your turn! Change or add something in Markdown and make another commit: write a human-readable commit message, and press the green button to commit changes. 

## NOTES

It's a lot to get familiar with markdown if you haven't used it previously!
